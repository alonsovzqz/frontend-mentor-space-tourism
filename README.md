## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML ARIA attributes
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

- I learned how to create a system desgin from the beginning and how it helps to speed up the development process once everything is in place.

- Adding CSS custom properties is a life changer since you can update them based on where you set them and always have a default value for it.

- The fact that CSS3 has with a lot of built-in functions that helps with responsiveness is outstanding.

- Adding accessibility attributes and HTML5 markup will never conflict with CSS styles or JavaScript. Therefore, every website should be designed to work with accessibility tools.

- Just let me add it again: **Always add accesibility attributes and semantic HTML5 markup**

- Now I now a little bit more about how CSS Grid works. I always been working with Flexbox but now that I know CSS Grid and make them work together are a powerful tool for layout and styling pages.


### Continued development

I'd like to use all this knowledge to create a design system using tools like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and explore using other technologies to recreate this project like using [React.js](https://react.dev/) and maybe add the design system and the actual app into a mono repo.

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba: Space Travel](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) - It is a free course that helps you create an application from scratch by setting small challenges throughout the course to reinforce concepts and help generate analytical thinking when applying a solution.
